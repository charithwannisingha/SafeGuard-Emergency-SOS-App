**SafeGuard** is a comprehensive, life-saving emergency response and real-time location-sharing platform designed to bridge the gap between individuals in critical situations and their emergency contacts or system administrators. 

The system architecture consists of a cross-platform **React Native mobile application** for end-users to dispatch instant alerts, and a web-based **Laravel Admin Dashboard** for real-time incident monitoring, response tracking, and analytics.

## 📱 Core Features

### Mobile Application (React Native)
* **One-Tap SOS Alert:** Trigger an immediate emergency status by holding the SOS button for 3 seconds.
* **Real-Time GPS Tracking:** Captures and shares precise live coordinates (`Latitude & Longitude`) along with regional address details.
* **Instant Email Notifications:** Dispatches automated email alerts via PHP Mail/SMTP directly to pre-configured emergency contacts upon trigger.

### Admin Dashboard (Laravel)
* **Live Incident Monitoring:** Real-time top banner alerts immediately show active incidents (e.g., *Active Alert: Amali Fernando has triggered SOS from Kandy*).
* **System Metrics & Analytics:** Interactive graphs tracking weekly/monthly incident volume, resolutions, and mail dispatch rates.
* **Alert Breakdown Panel:** Visual representation of alert statuses categorized into *Resolved*, *False Alarm*, and *Active*.
* **User & Contact Management:** Centralized management system to handle registered users and emergency contacts.
